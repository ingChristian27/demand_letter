  "<p>Dear Ms. Smith,</p>" +
  "<p>I’m writing to recommend Mary Thompson for the position of administrative assistant at Acme Corp. I’ve had the opportunity to work with Mary for the past few years at CBI Industries, and have been consistently impressed with her diligence, efficiency, and ability to get things done.</p>" +
  "<p>Most recently, Mary has worked for me directly as a receptionist in our main office. In this role, she performed many administrative tasks in addition to greeting customers and other visitors and organizing team events. For example, she currently manages our executive team’s schedules and organizes their appointments, as well as coordinating travel and expense reporting.&nbsp;</p>" +
  "<p>I believe that Mary would be an excellent addition to your administrative staff. I’ve been consistently impressed with her organizational skills and grace under pressure. In our industry, as you know, every position is a customer service position. Mary constantly seeks to learn more about our products and programs so that she can help serve our clients and mitigate issues as they come up. She’s also a quick learner who picks up new technology with great speed.</p>" +
  "<p>I strongly recommend Mary for the position of administrative assistant at your company. She’s organized, detail-oriented, effective, and committed to getting the job done. She’d make an excellent addition to your team.</p>" +
  "<p>Please feel free to contact me at 555-555-5555 if you have any questions.</p>" +
